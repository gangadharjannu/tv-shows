# Next steps

- [x] Setup husky and lint-staged to prevent unsafe code push to the repository.
- [] CI/CD - Done with Github Actions.
- [] Live version.
- [] Use state management either with Redux or with React Context API (I feel this applicaiton doesn't need state management and I didnt have much time to setup redux and write all the boilerplate as I had to squeeze the time to do this challenge)
- [] Unit testing.
